# ZombievsPlants


In the second year of my college studies, I undertook a project with the objective of creating a replica of the renowned "Plants vs. Zombies" game.
Leveraging C# and the MonoGame framework, I dedicated myself to the meticulous development of this project, showcasing my proficiency in programming and game design within an academic setting.
